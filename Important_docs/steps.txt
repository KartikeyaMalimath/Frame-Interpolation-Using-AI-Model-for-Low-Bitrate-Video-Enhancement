Set up your project structure: Create the necessary directories and files for your project. This may include directories for data, models, scripts, and any other components you plan to include.

Split the video into frames: Write a script using OpenCV to split your video into individual frames. Save these frames in a directory within your project structure.

Implement the custom data loader: Create a Python script to load and preprocess the frames for training. This could involve resizing the frames, normalizing pixel values, and any other necessary preprocessing steps. Use PyTorch's DataLoader class as a base and customize it to suit your specific requirements.

Implement the custom interpolation algorithm: Develop your interpolation algorithm using PyTorch and the DALL-E model. This algorithm should take a pair of input frames, generate intermediate frames using DALL-E, and output the interpolated frames. You may need to experiment with different techniques and architectures to achieve the desired results.

Implement evaluation metrics: Write code to calculate evaluation metrics such as PSNR or SSIM to assess the quality of the interpolated frames. You can use existing libraries like scikit-image or implement the metrics from scratch.

Build the user interface: Use Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for your application. This will allow users to interact with the interpolation process, input video files, and view the interpolated frames.

Train and test your model: Use the custom data loader to load your training data and train your interpolation algorithm. Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation metrics you implemented.

Optimize for GPU usage: Ensure that your code is properly configured to utilize your Nvidia GPU for accelerated training and inference. Check that the necessary GPU drivers and the CUDA toolkit are installed and properly set up.

Fine-tune and iterate: As you test your project, you may identify areas for improvement. Fine-tune your interpolation algorithm, experiment with different parameters, and iterate on your implementation to achieve better results.
